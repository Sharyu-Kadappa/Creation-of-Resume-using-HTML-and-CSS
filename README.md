**BUSSINESS OVERVIEW-->** The Supply Chain Management (SCM) project is designed to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and responsiveness of the organization’s end-to-end supply chain operations. Supply chain covers all stages from procurement of raw materials, production, warehousing, distribution, and final delivery to customers. In today’s competitive market, businesses face challenges such as fluctuating demand, rising logistics costs, supplier reliability issues, and the need for real-time decision-making. These inefficiencies often lead to delays, excess inventory, poor customer satisfaction, and increased operational costs.The objective of this project is to build a data-driven SCM system that provides visibility into the entire supply chain, identifies bottlenecks, forecasts demand accurately, and optimizes inventory and logistics. By leveraging data analytics and reporting, the organization will be able to:
1) Optimize procurement by identifying reliable suppliers and reducing lead times.
2) Improve inventory management by avoiding stockouts and overstocking.
3) Enhance logistics planning to reduce transportation costs and improve delivery timelines.

**PROJECT SCOPE-->** The scope of this project covers the analysis, design, and implementation of a data-driven Supply Chain Management (SCM) system to streamline operations across procurement, production, warehousing, logistics, and distribution.
**a) Data Collection & Integration**
Consolidating data from suppliers, warehouses, logistics, and sales systems.
**b) Demand Forecasting**
Developing predictive models to forecast customer demand and seasonal trends.
**c) Inventory Optimization**
Monitoring stock levels, reducing excess inventory, and preventing stockouts.
**d) Supplier Performance Analysis**
Evaluating lead times, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of suppliers.
**e) Logistics & Distribution Planning**
Optimizing transportation routes, reducing delivery time and costs.
**f) Dashboard & Reporting**
Building interactive dashboards for supply chain KPIs (lead time, fill rate, inventory turnover, order cycle time, etc.).

--> TOOLS USED: ✅ MICROSOFT EXCEL ✅ MICROSOFT POWER BI ✅ MySQL ✅ TABLEAU
--> KPIs: 
1) Total Sales(MTD,QTD,YTD).
2) Calculate top performing, under performing product wise sales.
3) Measure the percentage increase and decrease in Sales Growth.
4) Analyzes sale performance on daily bases to spot patterns, peaks, or dips in sales activity.
5) Highlights the five stores with the highest sales, helping to identify star performers and best practices.
6) Inventory Value-- Represents the monetary value of the current inventory based on the cost or maket value.
7) Purchase Method Wise Sales-- Break down the sales based on the method of purchase such as online, in-store, cash & credit.
 
**Hence,**
The Supply Chain Management project successfully delivered a comprehensive, data-driven solution to improve operational efficiency and decision-making. By integrating data from procurement, inventory, logistics, and sales, we developed interactive dashboards that provide real-time visibility into key supply chain metrics such as demand forecasts, supplier performance, inventory turnover, and delivery timelines.

The dashboards and predictive models not only highlight bottlenecks but also enable proactive decision-making, reducing costs and enhancing customer satisfaction. This project establishes a strong foundation for an agile, efficient, and scalable supply chain, empowering the business to adapt to market changes and maintain a competitive advantage.
